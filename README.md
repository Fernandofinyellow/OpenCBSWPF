==========

Adaptive open-source technology for microfinance.  OpenCBS is an open-source loan tracking software for microfinance institutions.  The main features are:  Client management Loan management Savings management Collateral management Loan schedule generation Loan portfolio tracking Custom fields Standard reports Custom reports Plugins and more.  OpenCBS is a fork of the last open-source version of Octopus Microfinance Suite, which started in 2006.  The mid- and long-term vision is to convert the program into a platform through a service-oriented architecture. It means minimizing the core, improving the extensibility framework, and making it frictionless for third-party developers to build upon.
